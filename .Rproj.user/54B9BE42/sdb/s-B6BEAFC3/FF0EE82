Visualizations  \n\n### Quan's Stories ###\n\n#### A. Start with a green thing in non-aggregated mode and make a boxplot ####\n\nFor **Religions by Nation** dataset: \n\n- Put Name into Columns\n- Put Budgen into Rows\n- Choose Boxplot in Show Me\n\n![](./Graphics/Quan1.png)\n\n- Make a new barchart: put Name into Columns, Budgen into Rows\n- Pick out interesting countries (filtering by Name as CHN, DRV, JPN, MYA, THI)\n- Filter by Year greater than or equal to 1955 (to eliminate null values)\n- Put Year in Pages to create a timeline slider\n- Put Name in Marks as Color for labeling\n\n![](./Graphics/Quan2.png) \n\n**Interesting Findings:**\n\n-\tChina vs Japan: Even though China and Japan has a striking difference in total population, for the early period (1945 – 1970), their Buddhist population was comparable (with Japan’s being little higher). However, from 1970 onwards, Buddhist population in China increased markedly and steadily, outstripping Japan completely.\n\n-\tThe interesting point about China’s increase is that even though it was rapid, there was a sudden drop (by no less than 50%) between 1995 and 2000, followed by a sudden comeback and plateau right in 2005.\n\n-\tFor Vietnam, after long period of slow but steady increase in Buddhist population between 1955-1995, there appears a sharp increase and plateau in 2000 (from 6.5M to 40M between 1995 and 2000).\n\n#### B. Start with two green things and a map ####\n\nFor **Religions by Nation** dataset: \n\n- Choose Name's Geographic Role as Country/Region, then Add to Sheet\n- Filter by Nonreligpct to be at least 15% (eliminating insignificant data)\n- Put Year in Pages to create a timeline slider\n- For Marks, put Name into Color as labeling, and Nonreligpct into Label for showing values\n\n![](./Graphics/Quan4.png)\n\n- Create a new scatterplot: put Year into Columns and Nonreligpct into Rows\n- Put Name into Columns for different facets\n- Pick out interesting countries (filtering by Name as CHN, CUB, CZE, FIN, JAM, PRK, RUS, USA)\n- Put Name into Color in Marks for labeling\n\n![](./Graphics/Quan5.png)\n\n**Interesting Findings:**\n\n-\tThe behavior of nonreligious percentage in Czechoslovakia, Finland, and USA are considered normal. Thus, they are showned just for comparison.\n\n- The interesting behaviors are in countries that have an abrupt change in trend, or a sudden increase/decrease in nonreligious percentage of at least 10%.\n\n- Russia: sudden drop from 63% in 1995 to 12% in 2000.\n\n- North Korea: 79% in 1995 to 64% in 2000.\n\n- Jamaica: downward slope from 1960-1980, but a sharp turn upwards to 1990 and then gradual decrease.\n\n- Cuba: sharp increase from 0% in 1965 to 25% in 1970.\n\n- China: sharp increase in period 1945-1960.\n\n#### C. Start with a green thing in aggregated mode and make a histogram ####\n\nFor **Militarized Disputes** dataset: \n\n- Create a calculated field named Dispute Length = [End Year] - [Start Year] + 1\n- Choose Histogram in Show Me\n- In Dimensions, choose to edit Dispute Length (bin) and change bin size to 1\n\n![](./Graphics/Quan6.png)\n\n**Comment:** Result shows highest count of dispute length to be for 1 year, and the count decreases significantly as dispute length increases, which is expected and not interesting.\n\n<<<<<<< HEAD\n### War and those who flee it ###\n\nStarted with the **Military Disputes** dataset.\n\nWanted to take a look at the military disputes data. A couple key terms...\n\n![](./Graphics/James01.png)  \n\n![](./Graphics/James02.png)  \n\n![](./Graphics/James03.png)  \n\n![](./Graphics/James04.png)  \n\n\nMade a crosstab to look at the different disputes.   \n- To get country names, blended data with a dataset that connected country abbreviations to their full name.  \n\nThe military dispute dataset.  \n![](./Graphics/James05.png)  \n\nOkay, so can we correlate this data to the refugee movement out of these countries to see if we find any trends?  \n\n-The Refugee dataset.  \n![](./Graphics/JamesXX.png) \n\nLooking for trends...\nMethod:  \n- Inner join on our refugee data and the military dispute data.  \n- Cross tab, using the KPI of percentage of a country's population that moved out of country as refugees in the same year as a dispute.   \n\n![](./Graphics/James06.png)  \n\n![](./Graphics/James07.png)  \n\n\n- Unfortunatly, there doesn't seem to be a great many intersting trends. The data is terribly convaluted... What if we look by country, instead of by dispute number?\n\n![](./Graphics/James08.png) \n\n![](./Graphics/China.png) \n\n\n- So still not many trends, but the data China is interesting. A novice mistake would be to say that these conflicts created over a million refugees. BUT, we must remember that this is refugees in the same year as the conflict, not due to the conflict itself!\n\n- As it turns out, some of these conflicts that are rated as \"Wars\", actually only lasted one day! But, its still interesting that China had over a million refugees that year...\n\n\n\nSo lets look at China, decade by decade...\n\nMethod:  \n- Filter by years and State name.    \n- Include a term to track the number of conflicts through the decade.  \n\n\n#### 1960-1969\n![](./Graphics/James09.png) \n\n- Look at all those refugees! So what is happening? As it turns out, these years correlate exactly to the Cultural Revolution. It seems likely that these \"refugees\" are actually just displaced populuce  combined with a flight out of an increasingly restrictive regeim.  \n\n#### 1970-1979\n![](./Graphics/James10.png) \n\n- A very quiet decade. I suspect that a problem with the joins caused so few disputes to show up. Still a decent ammount of refugees, but nothing compared to what we saw earlier.  \n\n#### 1980-1989\n![](./Graphics/James11.png)  \n\n- In the 1980's we see an increasing number of conflicts, but almost no refugees whatsoever! We also notice that a great many of the conflicts are \"Revisionist\" conflicts: basically small civil \"wars\" or revolutions.  \n\n#### 1990-1991\n![](./Graphics/James12.png) \n\n- Now we see a huge change in 1993! A huge increase in the number of refugees to nearly one-hundred thousand per year. The conflicts weren't particularly deadly, and only about half of them were revisionist. This trend continues until 2008, the end of our data...  \n\n#### 2000-2008\n![](./Graphics/James13.png) \n\n- The trend starting in the 1990's continues, and we reach the end of our data.\n\n=======\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Denominational Dispersions\n\n- I thought it might be interesting, rather than comparing different religions to each other like so many apples and oranges, to compare different sects and denominations within a religion. To start, I laid out the two largest sects of the three largest religions against the \"other\" subset of that religion, to see how strongly these religions each coalesced into major denominations, like so:\n\n![](./Graphics/CJS C-SCATTER.png) \n![](./Graphics/CJS B-SCATTER.png) \n![](./Graphics/CJS I-SCATTER.png) \n\n- From this you can see that while populations often split comfortably across Protestant or Catholic and others, they either ascribe to one the major Buddhist and Islamic sects entirely or not at all.\n\n- When I tried paginating these results by year, something very suprising came to light:\n\n### 1995\n![](./Graphics/CJS I-SCATTER pre-shift.png) \n\n### 2000\n![](./Graphics/CJS I-SCATTER post-shift.png) \n\n- Where'd all the 'other's go? It would appear from this graph that between 1995 and 2000 an astonishing number of 'other' (unafilliated or less-represented denominations) Muslims became either Sunni or Shiite -- and mostly Sunni, by a large margin.\n\n- I decided to delve further, and look at each country individually. There, a pattern emerged, as you can see below:\n\n![](./Graphics/CJS PAKISTAN EX.png)\n\n- This is not a universal pattern, but you'll see that more than 40 countries show a near-total reorganization of their Muslim population into Sunni/Shiite between 1995 and 2000.\n\n- And if that's not odd enough, 6 Buddhist countries show the same reorganization:\n\n![](./Graphics/CJS LAOS EX.png)\n\n- Perhaps this was a regional shift? Let's check:\n\n![](./Graphics/CJS ISLAM MAP.png)\n\n![](./Graphics/CJS BUDDHISM MAP.png) \n\n- Nope! There's a moderate geographic correlation with the Buddhist shift, but with two major outliers (33% of the shift), and there's no regional correlation at all with the Islamic shift.\n\n- I found myself trawling Wikipedia and world news articles for major events in the Muslim and Buddhist worlds, but that quickly delved to the deepest reaches of conjecture. All we can say for sure from this data is: something massively significant happened in these two religious communities in the last half of the 90's.\n>>>>>>> 4f74822626a6006d836ca8d075970d9628a9dde4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 06.
